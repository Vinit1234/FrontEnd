Your challenge is to build out this mortgage repayment calculator and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

Input mortgage information and see monthly repayment and total repayment amounts after submitting the form
See form validation messages if any field is incomplete
Complete the form only using their keyboard
View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
