- Websites are responsive by default. It's us who kill the responsiveness.

#1: 
Don't set height and width.
If required, set width in percentage;
and to give height use padding.

Em vs rem - https://youtu.be/_-aDOAMmDHI




#2 Relative units - Ems and rems:

- ems are used in printing world.
- ems are relative to immediate parent. If no value is set, it 
is relative to 16px by default.
- use ems when you want to maintain propotion of te designed components 
(eg, designed button)
- If ems are set in nested child elements, there might be compounding effect
(compoundingly getting bigger or smaller).

- rems were introduced to solve this problem.
- rems are relative to root tag ie, <html> ie, ::root{}
- rem units keep everything consistent thoughout the webpage.

NOTE: By setting the font-size of parent element or root element, you can change
the font-size of entire website. Hence it is recommended to use these 
relative units ie, ems and rems.



NOTE:
Eg1.

.col-123{
    font-size:2em; /* means 16px *2 =32 */
    margin-bottom: 2em; /* means 2*(previously set em value (ie, of font-size)) ie, 2*32=64  */
    padding: 1rem;  /* Always relative to root; 16px by default */
}

Eg2.

<button class="btn"></button>
<button class="btn btn-small"></button>

.btn{
    background:black;
    color:white;
    
    /* keeps padding propotionate to font-size in elements having btn-small class*/
    /* ie,due to em padding adapts to font-size in the btn-small elements */
    padding: 1em 3em; 

    /*padding won't change if they are kept in rem here*/
    padding: 1rem 3rem; 

}

btn-small{
    /* Not recommended */
    font-size: 0.5em;
}



#3 Max-width

NOTE:
Setting a fixed width on an element tends to be a bad idea. Instead we can use percentages, which make our lives easier.
The only issue with this is, at large screens, things can get too big. Thankfully, we have max-width that can help us out!


#4 viewport units 

Viewport units are relative to browser's size on the screen.

Design based on viewport units break for mobile screens.

Avoid using viewport units as there are some accessibility issues.

Note: the difference between vw (or vh) and percentages is that vw and vh are relative to the viewport whereas percentages are relative to the parent element.
