## Bootstrap ===========================================

NOTE: For Bootstrap auto-complete in vscode, use extension HTML CSS Support by ecmel.


If you want to keep your project lightweight and want to run it when internet is 
available, use CDN links.
The downside of using CDN is that you cannot customize bootstrap.css

If you need your website to work offline too, then download source from the following link.
Also, if you want the ability to customize bootstrap, you need to download the source files from:
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/download/

ie,
https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/archive/v5.3.0.zip

NOTE: When source is downloaded you can keep the project light by including only 
those files that are needed from css and js folder.

To include locally downloaded bootstrap change location path's "/" to "\":

<link rel="stylesheet" href="..\bootstrap-5.3.3\dist\css\bootstrap.min.css"  >

<script src="../bootstrap-5.3.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"  ></script>

Include FontAwesome

<script src="https://kit.fontawesome.com/80efff2ccb.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>


==================================================================

- Two container classes:
.container (fixed width)
.container-fluid (full width ie, width of viewport)


.grid 
.row (12 columns by default)
.col-1 to .col-12

Breakpoints for screen sizes:
xs, sm, md, lg, xl, xxl


.col-sm-6
means take 6 column space in screen sizes >= sm

.col-lg-12
means take 12 column size in screen sizes >= lg


.row can accomodate .col(s) that sum up to column size of 12 in a single row. Anything greater than that will be pushed to next row automatically.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col col-md-4 box-1">Box-1</div>
    <div class="col col-md-8 box-2">Box-2</div>
    <div class="col col-md-4 box-3">Box-3</div>
</div>

Here, box-1 and box-2 come at 1st row and box-3 is pushed to the next row.


.offset-md-3 means leave 3 columns space and start with 4th column
